# A proposal for a Minecraft server for the IEEE Student Branch

We propose a part of the EE project server racks be dedicated to 
running a minecraft server for the IEEE student branch to facilitate 
learning and application of EE and CompE based concepts in a 
real-world application.

## Why minecraft?
   
* An easy to learn, free-roaming game (low cost of entry)
* Teaches students the application of EE and CompE concepts
* EE Topics
    * Circuits 
    * Computer Architecture
    * Software Development 
    * Algorithms
    * Networking
    * Linux and Operating Systems 

## Goals

* easily hack around and play with software
* engage students in EE and CompE concepts
* apply their skills in a _real world_ application
* learn teamwork and project management skills
* have fun!

## Supporting Cases

* [Scriptcraft](http://scriptcraftjs.org/) - Written to help educate 
younger kids how to program
* [PBS Media - is minecraft the ultimate educational tool](http://www.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/1e91b1aa-ae38-4877-b91e-c91da7b8d573/is-minecraft-the-ultimate-educational-tool/)
* [Could Minecraft be the next great engineering school?](http://qz.com/32868/could-minecraft-be-the-next-great-engineering-school/)
* [Redstone circuits in minecraft](http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/engineering-with-redstone-in-minecraft.html)


### Supporting case in-game 

* Redstone circuits!
    * Computer architecture 
    * Digital logic and circuit design

### Supporting case out-of-game

* Linux administration
    * Scripting
    * Operating systems

* Software development
    * Plugins
    * Plugin engines
    * Plugin frameworks
    * So much more
